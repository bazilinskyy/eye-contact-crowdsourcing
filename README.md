Exploration of eye contact in traffic by means of crowdsourcing
=======

## Setup
Tested with Python 3.8.5. To setup the environment run these two commands in a parent folder of the downloaded repository (replace `/` with `\` and possible add `--user` if on Windows):
- `pip install -e eye-contact-crowdsourcing` will setup the project as a package accessible in the environment.
- `pip install -r eye-contact-crowdsourcing/requirements.txt` will install required packages.
